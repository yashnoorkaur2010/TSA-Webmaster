We found our foreign wearable technology (the Oura Ring, founded by a Finnish company) by researching many different kinds of foreign technology that exist. As we were going through, this small yet insightful piece of technology really stood out to us. We have heard a lot about this ring in the past and have had many family members buy it, too. The features that this ring has are fascinating, especially since it's such a small device compared to what it can sense and provide you with. Not only this, but this ring was also a better alternative to existing smart watches because not only is it so discreet, but it also has many improved features that help track sleep better.
